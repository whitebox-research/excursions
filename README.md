# WhiteBox Research: Excursions

This is a repository of materials (demonstrations, write-ups, and prototypes) for rapidly learning (mechanistic) interpretability.

## Rationale

You know how great scientists keep research notebooks within reach at all times? This is kind of like those, except everything happens in a Jupyter notebook.

For an upskilling program, one wants to create lecture notes so that one is not led astray while teaching. But on the other hand, the Trials Phase of WhiteBox isn't strictly about students passively receiving wisdom from a bearded lecturer. It's about solving problems, formulating hypotheses, and then answering them.

The best way to convey that process to students is to do it yourself. The fact that it can serve as reference material for the actual course is incidental.

## Flow

The unit of stuff happening here is the **issue**. To pose a research question, or a curious rabbit hole, or a legitimate project (e.g. build a toy model), one creates an issue for it.

One then treats the issue's comment section as one's *research log*, detailing: thoughts, partial attempts, and anything that might be relevant to the resolution of the issue.

An issue doesn't have to be an entire research question. It can be as simple as a single line of code / LaTeX that one wants to explore more. It also doesn't have to be a self-contained problem (e.g. you can have an issue that goes like _"Find a better description of log-loss."_)

Here is an example of how issue-driven research is done in the wild: [LINK](https://github.com/simonw/public-notes/issues/1)
